# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Null Behavior in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a seemingly simple JavaScript bug related to handling null values in an addition function.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers.  However, the behavior when one or both inputs are `null` might not be immediately obvious to all developers.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the script using a JavaScript interpreter (e.g., Node.js).
4. Observe the output.  The function correctly handles null inputs, returning null if either input is null. This might be unexpected by some developers.

## Solution
The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  The solution involves explicitly handling null values, ensuring the function's behavior aligns with expectations.  The improvement is mostly about clarity.  If null values should be treated as 0, then the solution would modify this behavior.

## Lessons Learned
This bug highlights the importance of explicitly handling null and undefined values in JavaScript functions to avoid unexpected behavior and maintain code clarity.  A well-defined function specification should address how the function will respond to null or undefined inputs.
